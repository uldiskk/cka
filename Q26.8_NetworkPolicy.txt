Create a new NetworkPolicy named allow-port-from-namespace to allow Pods in the existing namespace internal to connect to port 9000 of other Pods in the same namespace.
Ensure that the new NetworkPolicy:
· does not allow access to Pods not listening on port 9000
· does not allow access from Pods not in namespace external



To prepare the training environment, please use:
kubectl create ns external
kubectl create ns internal
kubectl label ns external project=my-app
