An existing Pod needs to be integrated into the Kubernetes built-in logging architecture (e.g. kubectl logs). Adding a streaming sidecar container is a good and common way to accomplish this requirement.

Add a sidecar container named sidecar, using the busybox image, to the existing Pod big-corp-app. The new sidecar container has to run the following command:
/bin/sh -c "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/big-corp-app.log"

Use a Volume, mounted at /var/log, to make the log file big-corp-app.log available to the sidecar container.
