1. Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy with image nginx:1.16 and 2 replica. There are 2 nodes in cluster.

Please make sure no pod will get deployed on the node node01.

2. Check to see how many nodes are ready (not including nodes tainted NoSchedule) and write the number to file.txt.

Note: revert any changes that you did in cluser.

3. Can you force the opposite behavior of pod scheduling? Deploy pods only to the tainted node.

Note: revert any changes that you did in cluser.
